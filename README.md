## Getting Started

To view or work on this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cwlum/cwlum.github.io.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd cwlum.github.io
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**
    You can simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser to view the site. For a more robust local development experience, you can use a local web server. Many code editors (like VS Code with the "Live Server" extension) offer this functionality, or you can use Python's built-in HTTP server:
    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Or for Python 3:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    Then, open `http://localhost:8000` (or the port indicated by the server) in your browser.
